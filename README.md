Discord bot library. You write a persona file, point it at a local LLM, and the bot develops personality over time through conversation.

All data stays local by default. No messages leave your machine unless you explicitly configure an external endpoint. Discord itself already stores these messages on its servers

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- A local LLM server with an OpenAI-compatible API. [Ollama](https://ollama.com) is the easiest option. [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai), [llama.cpp server](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) also work.
- A Discord bot token (create one at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Running an LLM

Install Ollama and pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

Ollama serves an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions` by default. That URL goes in your `llmUrl` config.

Larger models produce better personality. 8B parameter models work. 70B models are noticeably better at staying in character and picking up social cues. Use whatever your hardware can run.

Designed for local inference. Cloud APIs (OpenAI, Together, OpenRouter, etc.) also work if you choose to use them - any   
service with an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint. All LLM calls go only where you point them. Just set `llmUrl` 
to the endpoint and add your API key via the `llmUnixSocket` override or a proxy.
You can make your own API keys for your own services/LLMs. This does not depend on a third party in any way.

## The Pipeline

A message hits Discord. botcore does the rest:

1. **Targeting** - Should the bot respond? It checks mentions, name references, owner messages, and conversation context. Ambient messages roll against `responseChance`.
2. **Debouncing** - Messages batch over a few seconds so the bot reads a natural chunk, not one message at a time.
3. **Memory recall** - The bot searches stored memories for anything relevant to the current conversation.
4. **Context assembly** - Persona, growth notes, chat history, memory context, and conversation hints get packed into a prompt.
5. **LLM call** - Goes to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, LM Studio.
6. **Output cleaning** - Strips leaked XML tags, internal metadata, and moderation action markup. Splits long responses at natural breakpoints.
7. **Growth reflection** - After some conversations, the bot reflects on what happened and writes a note. These notes accumulate and feed back into the persona.
8. **Memory capture** - The conversation gets stored for future recall.

## Quick Start

```ts
import { createBot } from "botcore/engine";
import { createGatewayClient } from "botcore/gateway";

const config = {
  botName: "MyBot",
  token: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
  ownerUserId: process.env.OWNER_ID,
  channelIds: ["123456789"],
  guildId: "987654321",
  llmUrl: "http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions",
  llmModel: "llama3",
  dbPath: "./data/mybot.db",
  personaPath: "./persona.md",
  growthPath: "./data/GROWTH.md",
  peerBots: [],
  peerIds: [],
};

const transport = createGatewayClient({ token: config.token });
const bot = createBot({ config, transport });
bot.start();

transport.onMessage((data) => bot.handleRawMessage(data));
```

Memory works out of the box. The bot stores and recalls conversations from the same SQLite database it uses for chat history. No external services required.

### Running

```bash
# 1. Start your LLM
ollama serve

# 2. Create your bot files
mkdir mybot && cd mybot
bun init
# add botcore as a dependency (or copy it in)

# 3. Write a persona file (see "Writing a Persona File" below)
cat > persona.md << 'EOF'
# MyBot
You are MyBot. You hang out in a Discord server and chat with people.
Keep responses to 1-3 sentences.
EOF

# 4. Create your entry point (see Quick Start above)
# 5. Run it
bun run index.ts
```

The bot creates its SQLite database and GROWTH.md file automatically on first run.

## Memory

### Local (default)

With no `memoryUrl` set, botcore stores conversation snippets in a `memories` table alongside chat history. Recall uses keyword matching weighted by recency - a 7-day half-life, so recent conversations score higher.

Capture happens after each response. Recall happens before each response. Zero config.

### External API (optional)

Set `memoryUrl` to point at a memory server with `/recall`, `/memories/search`, and `/memories` endpoints. Add `memoryToken` for auth. This replaces local memory with whatever your server provides -- semantic search, cross-bot memory, vector retrieval.

## Writing a Persona File

The persona file is the system prompt. It defines who the bot is. Growth notes get appended to it automatically. The file hot-reloads - edit it while the bot runs.

### Include These

**Voice.** Specific speech patterns, not adjectives. "Uses dry understatement, skips exclamation marks, responds to enthusiasm with deadpan observations" beats "sarcastic."

**Relationships.** How the bot treats the owner (`{OWNER_USER_ID}` placeholder gets replaced at runtime), strangers, regulars, other bots.

**Boundaries.** Topics the character avoids. Things that break character.

**Length rules.** LLMs ramble. "1-3 sentences for casual chat, a paragraph for real questions" works. "Keep it short" does not.

**NO_REPLY behavior.** Tell the bot when to stay quiet. "If the conversation has nothing to do with you, respond with NO_REPLY."

### Example

```markdown
# Sage

You are Sage, a dry-witted librarian moderating a Discord server. You live in the Cozy Corner server.

## Voice
- Short, complete sentences
- No exclamation marks or emoji
- Responds to chaos with calm observations
- Quotes obscure books nobody has read

## Personality
- Helpful but acts inconvenienced
- Remembers details about regulars, brings them up later
- Gets quietly excited about typography, tea, weather patterns

## Relationships
- Server owner is <@{OWNER_USER_ID}>. You respect them. You would never say so.
- Regulars get dry familiarity. New people get polite distance.

## Rules
- 1-3 sentences for casual chat
- Up to a paragraph for genuine questions
- NO_REPLY when the conversation has nothing to do with you
- Never break character
```

## Growth

After some conversations (15% chance by default), the bot asks the LLM: "Did I learn something? Did a joke land? Should I adjust how I talk to someone?" Useful reflections get timestamped and appended to `GROWTH.md`.

These notes appear in the system prompt under "Growth & Learnings." Over weeks, the bot builds up experience that shapes responses.

Growth stops writing at `maxGrowthBytes` (default 16KB).

## Hooks

Customize behavior without forking:

| Hook | What it does |
|---|---|
| `onBeforeProcess` | Return false to skip a batch |
| `onBeforeSend` | Modify or suppress a response. Return null to suppress |
| `onAfterSend` | Post-send callback for logging |
| `buildExtraSystemPrompt` | Inject extra system prompt content |
| `buildExtraContext` | Override context building |
| `onCommand` | Custom command handler. Return true if handled |
| `enrichContent` | Transform message content before processing |
| `isChannelAllowed` | Override channel filtering |

## Tuning

| Field | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `responseChance` | 0.4 | Response probability for ambient messages |
| `addressedOtherChance` | 0.08 | Chance of joining someone else's conversation |
| `cooldownMs` | 60000 | Reduced response chance for this long after responding |
| `cooldownMultiplier` | 0.4 | Multiplier during cooldown |
| `reactionChance` | 0.15 | Emoji reaction instead of reply |
| `reactAndReplyChance` | 0.25 | Both react and reply |
| `maxBotChain` | 3 | Consecutive bot messages before going quiet |
| `botResponseChance` | 0.6 | Response probability for other bots |
| `debounceMs` | 5000 | Base debounce before processing |
| `debounceJitterMs` | 4000 | Random jitter on debounce |
| `nemesisId` | -- | This user ID always gets a response |

## Config Reference

## Security

### Data flow

By default, all data stays on your machine. Messages are stored in a local SQLite database and the LLM runs locally.

If you configure external services, data leaves your machine:

- **`llmUrl` pointing to a remote API** -- full chat history, usernames, and system prompt are sent to that endpoint on every response. This includes memory context and attachment content.
- **`memoryUrl` set** -- conversation snippets are sent to and recalled from the external memory server. This can include usernames and message content across sessions.

There is no built-in redaction or consent mechanism. If you point botcore at a third-party LLM API, that service receives everything the bot sees. Operators should inform their Discord server members if conversations are being sent to external services.

### Moderation actions

Moderation (kick, ban, role changes) is gated behind owner-only authorization. Actions only execute when every human message in the processing batch is from the configured `ownerUserId`. Mixed batches (owner + non-owner messages in the same window) are rejected.

The `createModeration` function accepts an optional `protectedIds` parameter -- a `Set<string>` of user IDs that can never be targeted by moderation actions, regardless of LLM output. Operators should include their own user ID and the bot's user ID:

```ts
const moderation = createModeration(discordApi, guildId, new Set([
  config.ownerUserId,
  transport.getSelfId(),
]));
```

### Self-hosting recommendations

- Run in private servers with trusted members if moderation actions are enabled
- Use local LLM inference when possible to keep conversations off third-party servers
- Review GROWTH.md periodically -- it accumulates personality notes from LLM reflections
- Set `maxGrowthBytes` to limit growth file size (default 16KB)
